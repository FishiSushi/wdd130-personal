                    <h2>Introducing One Page One Shots</h2>

                    <p>
                        We know the hobby is growing: more children, teens, and adults are finding TTRPGs for the first
                        time - as popular YouTube series, tv shows, and movies have brought what was once the domain of
                        prepubescent basement dwellers out into the light of day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are more willing players than ever before, players who have spawned online communities
                        specifically to play together. Online platforms that make communicating and playing together
                        across vast distances trivial. There are endless assets, adventure modules, and supplemental
                        materials, more than you could ever use in a lifetime and all at the click of a button.
                    </p>

                    <h3>So, why One Page One Shots?</h3>

                    <p>
                        At One Page One Shots, we have jobs, families, extracurricular activities, side hustles, and all
                        the other responsibilities that come with adulting. Our free time is often rare and precious,
                        and we do not want to spend all our time prepping for our adventuresâ€¦ we want to play! Our
                        modules take almost no time to prepare and are endlessly modifiable. Run them as a one-off
                        adventure or drop them into an existing campaign - your creativity is the limit!
                    </p>
