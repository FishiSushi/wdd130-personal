            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Modules for table-top role-playing games are a pain to prepare.
                There is nothing like reading a massive tome filled with story,
                lore, canned adventure text, stat blocks, and loot tables before
                you can even plan your very first session. Not to mention the
                price, in some cases as much or more than the core rulebooks.
                Sometimes all you want is a good starting point or one-off
                adventure to dip your toes in.
            </p>
            <p>
                My solution? “One Page One-Shots”, a web store/blog dedicated to
                short-form modules that do not break the bank or take hours of
                preparation to play.

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                Tabletop roleplaying enthusiasts. Specifically, busy game
                masters looking for a quick and easy module for their next
                session so they can focus on their other responsibilities
                without comprising their favorite hobby. In recent years, the
                popularity of TTRPGs has increased, and we expect to see a wide
                range of players from all ages (10+). Given the social nature of
                TTRPGs, we also expect visitors to use both mobile and desktop
                devices.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

            <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

                Product #1: The Listing Gull A party of adventurers are seeking
                passage to a remote sky port. They hear of an airship, the
                Listing Gull, soon to depart with essential supplies to their
                desired destination. The skies ahead, the wilderness below hold
                many potential hazards… <span>$5.00</span>

                Product #2: Yet Another Dark Forest The millwright's children
                have disappeared. The grandfather, an aged tracker, comes to the
                Inn seeking aid in tracking them down and returning them to
                their parents. <span>$5.00</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Product #3: A Decrepit Shack Local tales tell of an old ruin in
                the woods, once home to a reclusive priest, who ceased coming
                into town a week passed. Concerned passersby speak of a strange
                mist that clings to the woods around his cabin, shadows moving
                in the dark, and quiet whispers that speak of ill intent.

            <p>Blog Post #1: Title: Introducing One Page One Shots</p>

            <p>
                We know the hobby is growing: more children, teens, and adults
                are finding TTRPGs for the first time - as popular YouTube
                series, tv shows, and movies have brought what was once the
                domain of prepubescent basement dwellers out into the light of
                day. There are more willing players than ever before, players
                who have spawned online communities specifically to play
                together. Online platforms that make communicating and playing
                together across vast distances trivial. There are endless
                assets, adventure modules, and supplemental materials, more than
                you could ever use in a lifetime and all at the click of a
                button. So, why One Page One Shots? At One Page One Shots, we
                have jobs, families, extracurricular activities, side hustles,
                and all the other responsibilities that come with adulting. Our
                free time is often rare and precious, and we do not want to
                spend all our time prepping for our adventures… we want to play!
                Our modules take almost no time to prepare and are endlessly
                modifiable. Run them as a one-off adventure or drop them into an
                existing campaign - your creativity is the limit!
